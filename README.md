# Project-Antek-
Project of a website created during Kodilla Bootcamp

------------------------------------------------

In this project I've been using only HTML and CSS. I resisted for now from using Flexbox (coming up in the next project!). 
The project uses also:
'Fontawesome'
'Google Fonts'


/* TO DO */

Figure out how to manage with the image of iPhone.
Insert screenshots of the project in the readme.md
