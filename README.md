# Project-Antek-
Project of a website created during Kodilla Bootcamp

------------------------------------------------

In this project I've been using HTML and CSS only. I've resisted from using Flexbox (coming up in the next project!) for now. 
The project also uses:
'Fontawesome'
'Google Fonts'
